# Milestone

Milestone is a Java/Flink project.

It was developped to be a "milestone" in my Flink learning progression as a Data Manager and Big Data developper internship at OVH Group.
It processes dummy financial data generated by the Charlotte project (view my other repositories) in batches. None of this data is real and there is no sensitive data related to my company or any other person.

# Properties
Check milestone.properties file and adapt the values around to run the various processes. The switch case is not very optimal or production-grade code and is only there to make it easy to manipulate and play around with the different processes.

# Input
The desired input is a .csv file, of any size as Flink is extremely performant with them.

# Output
The output can be defined as Text, Csv, and much more. By default, the DataSink will parallelize the output into as many files as the parralelism was set to.
